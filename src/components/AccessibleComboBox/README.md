# Exercise: Accessible Combobox Component

## Requirements

- **Keyboard Navigation**: The Combobox must be fully navigable using the keyboard alone.
- **ARIA Roles and Properties**: The Combobox must incorporate appropriate ARIA roles and properties to convey its structure and state to assistive technologies.
- **Visual Feedback**: The Combobox must provide clear visual cues for focus states and expanded/collapsed sections.

## Accessibility Details

We will be following the guidelines defined by [W3C Combobox Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/).

## Example Implementation

## Additional Considerations

- **Content Accessibility**: Ensure that the content within the Combobox is also accessible, with proper heading structure, image alt text, and other accessibility features.
- **Animation**: If you use animation to show/hide the content, make sure it doesn't cause accessibility issues. Provide options to disable animations or adjust their speed.
- **Screen Reader Testing**: Test the Combobox with screen readers to ensure that the information is conveyed clearly and the interaction is smooth.
